4:41 PM 9/25/2015 meet Ran, Harry (where's Safinah?) about addition/subtraction

Jack ask Safinah [ ] change meetings to 4:40pm?

Questions:
1. What happens at each level of game?
2. Combine?
	Concept of + and - using concrete quantity representations
		Teach |A| + |B| = |{A U B}|:
			Building Blocks well-validated
Ran [DONE] send description of Building Blocks 
			1. Start with A, e.g. 3 balls
			2. "Add 2 balls" 
				a. drag 2 balls
				b. Tap +1 button to add ball
Jack ask Hima [DONE 5:26 PM 9/25/2015] graphical +1 action for counting <-- DO THIS
			
			3. "How many have now?" NumberListen(5)
			"" -> "count them" -> tutor counts
			5 -> "Yes, 3 balls + 2 balls = 5 balls"
			~5 -> "No, 3 balls + 2 balls = 5 balls"
			
		Teach count-up and count-down
			Show:  like 2b but say "makes 3+i"
			Scaffold:  like 2b but prompt "makes...", ListenNumber(3+i)
				3+i -> "yes, 3+i"
				other -> "no, 3+i"
				"" -> "... 3+i" (just supply the number if student doesn't)
		Then same but show symbols too.
		Then keep symbols but hide concrete representation except when needed as hint (grounded feedback).

	Convert to 1-digit math facts
		Use "count up" 
		Memorize math facts -- use NumberListen(x+y) because fastest; feedback same as above

		Once master small numbers, graduate to larger (>6? = too large to subitize) 1-digit numbers.  No more concrete representations.

THEN.... Introduce 2-digit numbers.
	Show: animation of |||||||| "9" + 1 -> |||||||||| "10"
	Show "10" + |||||||| = 19 + 1 -> "20"

	Show place value:  10's place = # of groups of 10, 1's place = # leftovers
	Animation shows highlighting each group of 10 and counting # of groups -- "1, 2, ..." -> into 10's place
	|||||||||| 
	|

	|||||||||| 
	||
	...

	|||||||||| 
	|||||||||| 
Audiovisually 
etc. associate # groups with # in 10's place, e.g. by highlighting and counting, maybe later by using { to skip the counting

2-digit addition and subtraction procedures:
	Start with problems without carry or borrow.
		AB + CD
	1. Show procedure.
	2. Assisted practice:  highlight and say "B + D = " to prompt for each spoken digit; then same for "A + C".

	Critique:  catch 1-digit addition errors by simulated student.
Safinah & Harry [ ] How should student announce errors?
a. ASR:  Tutor occasionally asks "right?"; teach student to respond"yes, #" or "no, #".
+:  seems natural
-:  ASR errors?
Jack [ ] tell Haonan to support listening for combination of word and number.
b. Finger-writing?
c. Other?


Harry & Jack [DONE] use Building Blocks activities Ran sent 5:01 PM 9/25/2015 to brainstorm activities.
McGraw-Hill uses them in proprietary software.

Harry & Safinah [ ]  What else do you glean from these activities?

Ran [ ] Are vivid detailed objects better than abstract artificial objects?
5:21 PM 9/25/2015 asked Ran.

ask Ran [ ] better to get fluent on no-carry and no-borrow problems before progressing to carry and borrow?
Jack guesses not, lest interfere with learning to carry and borrow.
Already fluent with 1-digit math facts.

BESIDES OR INSTEAD OF SPOKEN INPUT, USE FINGER-WRITING.
NEED TO FLESH OUT THE REST -- WHICH STEPS, WHAT INPUT, WHAT FEEDBACK TO RIGHT AND WRONG RESPONSES, HINTS WHEN NO RESPONSE:
	Then teach carry and borrow.

	Show carry.  Introduce carry box above 10's column.
Safinah and Harry [ ] what to display for borrow?

	Assisted practice:
		Expect carry in carry box.  Finger-writing here needed for student to show where to put the number.
		Try to write elsewhere -> prompt to carry.

	Critique:
		Turn tables -- catch mistakes by simulated student.
		- Failure to carry.
		- Carry when shouldn't.
		- Mis-add 1's column.
		- Mis-add 10's column.

	How should student respond to each type of error?
	Spoken as with no-carry problems?  But how respond to failure to carry?

	Finger-written?  Respond to either type of carry error by tapping in carry box.
	
	(Everything same for borrow?  If not, how differs? -- needs to decrement 10's place #.  How cross out and replace?)
